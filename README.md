# **Description**
Chat_box is a simple test project that establishes a connection to a streamer's Twitch chat using the IRC (Internet Relay Chat) protocol. Developed in Java with a JavaFX frontend, this project demonstrates how to connect to Twitch's chat system and perform a basic OAuth authentication.

The OAuth implementation uses a randomly generated Twitch Developer OAuth code, primarily to test the connection and interaction with the Twitch chat.

# **Features**
- IRC Connection: Connects to Twitch's chat server using the IRC protocol.

- OAuth Authentication: Implements OAuth authentication with Twitch to access the chat.

- JavaFX GUI: Provides a simple graphical user interface for the application.

- Random OAuth Code: For testing purposes, a random OAuth code is generated (simulated authentication).
